## Bio (Short)

Physics AI engineer building the future of computational simulation. PhD in Scientific Machine Learning from Penn State, now deploying production ML models for complex physics at Luminary Cloud.

## Bio (Extended)

I'm a Forward Deployed Engineer at Luminary Cloud, where I'm the "tip of the spear" — building physics-specific machine learning models for domains like CFD and working directly with engineering clients to create custom AI solutions that transform traditional design optimization workflows.

My research background is in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), with deep expertise in graph neural networks, neural operators, and high-performance computing. I build surrogate models that make complex physics simulations faster, more scalable, and more accessible.

## Current Role — Luminary Cloud

**Forward Deployed Engineer, Simulations and Physics AI**

- Building physics-specific ML models (currently focused on CFD)
- Working with engineering clients to provide custom AI solutions
- Addressing pain points in traditional engineering workflows (e.g., design optimization pipelines)
- Bridging cutting-edge ML research with real-world engineering applications

*Note: Only discuss publicly available information. Do not mention crash simulations or other non-public work.*
